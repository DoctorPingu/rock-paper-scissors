# Rock, Paper, Scissors ðŸŽ®

Welcome to **Rock, Paper, Scissors**, a simple Python implementation of the classic hand game. In this game, you play against the computer to determine the winner. The first to win 3 rounds is declared the victor!

## How It Works
1. The game starts with a main menu where you can choose to start or exit.
2. Before starting, you can view the rules of the game.
3. During each round:
   - You select either **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.
   - The computer randomly selects its move.
   - The winner of the round is determined based on the rules:
     - Rock beats Scissors.
     - Scissors beats Paper.
     - Paper beats Rock.
4. The game continues until either the player or the computer wins 3 rounds.
5. Final scores and the winner are displayed at the end of the game.

## Features
- **Menu System**: Navigate easily with clear options to start or exit.
- **Rule Explanation**: Option to view the rules before playing.
- **Round-Based Gameplay**: Play against the computer in a best-of-5 format.
- **Randomised Computer Moves**: Ensures a fair and unpredictable experience.
